# Beacon Tracker App #
## Intro ##
The BLE Tracker Lib is an android app to track Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Beacons. You can view them on a map and get details what they are sending.

## Motivation ##
We are two cybersecurity students from [CISPA](https://cispa.saarland/). Our motivation is to get a view where and how much BLE trackers used for benign reasons and or tracking you.
